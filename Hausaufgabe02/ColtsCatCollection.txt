Big Cat

The term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus namely tiger, lion,
jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard.[1] Except the snow leopard, these species are able to roar. A more liberal and
expansive definition of the term includes species outside of Panthera including the couga clouded leopard,
Sunda clouded leopard, cheetah and sometimes the several lynx species, although these add species also do not
roar.
Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite similar in both structure and behaviour,
with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats are
carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia.
