    <h1>Big Cat</h1>
    <p>
      The term "<strong>big cat</strong>" is typically used to refer to any of
      the five living members of the genus
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera"><em>Panthera</em> </a>
      namely tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard.[1] Except the snow
      leopard, these species are able to roar. A more liberal and expansive
      definition of the term includes species outside of Panthera including the
      couga clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard, cheetah and sometimes the
      several lynx species, although these add species also do not roar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite
      similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the
      cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats.
      All cats are carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their
      native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia.
